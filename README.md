# AQMS - Air Quality Monitoring System

AQMS is my final project of the bechlor degree.

Due to my absent class activities, 
I develop my final project all by myself with 
Asst.Prof.Dr.Visit Hirankitti as my project advisor. 

It is a Python web application develop with Django Webframework.

It is also my first Django project that I learn and code along the way.
